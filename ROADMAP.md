# Ideas to implement next

- Ability to "protect" specific folder

- Somewhow have file name comparison to enable rules based on them, or even just displaying colors based on similarity

- Look inside photos app library, and tell photos to delete them.

- Hint for path : display pathname, like for file name (on hover)

- Similar auto delete (keep biggest if) : 

    - same duration

    - different file sizes

    - one has name contained within other file's name

    - similarity = 100%


- Exact auto delete (same size, duration etc : which to keep ?)

    -
